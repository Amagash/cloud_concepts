# Elastic compute cloud
## Overview
- EC2 is like a Virtual Machine
- Select the capacity you need right now
- Grow and shrink when needed
- Pay for what you use
- Wait minutes, not months

## EC2 Instance pricing
- On demand: The most flexible, pay by the hour or the second depending on the type of instance.
- Spot: Purchase unused capacity at a discount of up to 90%. Great for applications with flexible start and end times.
- Reserved: Reserved capacity for 1 or 3 years. Up to 72% discount on the hourly charge. Great if you have known, fixed requirements.
- Dedicated: A physical EC2 server dedicated for your use. Great if you have server-bound licenses to reuse or compliance requirements

## AWS CLI
- Always use the least privilege rule
- Use Groups for permissions
- Secret access key: you only see it once so save it in a safe place otherwise you'll have to regenerate it
- Don't share your key pairs. Only one user per key pair.
- Supports Lunix, Windows and MacOS.

## Using roles
- Best Practice: Use roles
- Avoid hard coding your credentials: roles provide access without the use of access keys
- Policies: Control role permissions
- Updates: You can update a policy and it will take effect immediately
- Attaching and Detaching: You can attach or detach roles to running EC2 Instances without having to stop or terminate these instances.
